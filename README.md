# Phylogenetics and the human microbiome.

The human microbiome is the collection of microbes that live inside and on humans.
The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and the Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract (MetaHIT) consortia have advanced human microboime research by generating thousands of 16s surveys and terabases of metagenomic data on the human microbiome, as well as funding bioinformatics and statistical development.
In this talk I will review the impact of phylogenetics and tree-thinking on the methods used in the analysis of this data, as well as describing current challenges for phylogenetics coming from this type of work.

## Part 1. Introduction

* Definition of the human microbiome
* Remarkable quantity, diversity, and metabolic potential
* Summary of what has been learned. The microbiome
    * is dynamic in terms of representation but apparently constant in terms of function
    * is spatially organized; spatial diversity often exceeds inter-individual differences
    * antibiotics have a long term effect
* Ongoing discussions or sample-dependent results
    * whether microbial "types" exist
    * role of microbiome in obesity
* Data products

## Part 2. Tree-thinking in human microbiome research

* Phylogenetics as a framework on which data can be organized
* Phylogenetics and microbial taxonomy
    * Woese' legacy
    * Bergey's, GreenGenes, Silva
    * Automated methods: GRUNT and tax2tree
* Tree-based classification versus machine learning methods
* Curation of human microboime databases using phylogenetics
* Phylogenetics and the search for "most wanted" organisms for genome sequencing
* Community summaries: variants of phylogenetic diversity and their use
* Community comparison: UniFrac distance and variants, and principal components/coordinates visualizations.

## Part 3. Phylogenetic inference as practiced by human microbiome researchers

* Alignment
* MEGAN and related algorithms
* FastTree
* RNA copy number
* Clustering and the "species" delineation problem
* Chimeric sequences
* Phylogenetic placement

## Part 4. Phylogenetic challenges coming from human microbiome research

* Fragmentary data
* Horizontal gene transfer
* What is the role of phylogenetics in detailed analysis of microbe/host interactions?
