# Introduction to human microbiome research

Overview of major findings.


# Phylogenetics and taxonomy

Without a doubt, the greatest impact that phylogenetics has had on microbial ecology research is on changing our view of the taxonomic relationships between microorganisms.
In the absence of sequencing, microbiologist have to rely on microscopes and staining.
Lots of little things look alike.

The most stunning example of this is the discovery of the archaea by Woese.

However, there have been

There are projects that use phylogeny to revise taxonomy, short of PhyloCode.
GreenGenes.
The reason people are attached to taxonomy is that there is a lot of information using taxonomic labels.

Much of this work has been done using the 16s ribosomal rRNA gene.

With the advent of high throughput sequencing, there has been a lot of interest concerning which variable region to use.


# Diversity estimates using phylogenetics

Variants of phylogenetic diversity and their use.


# Community comparison using phylogenetics

UniFrac distance and variants.

Figure: example principal coordinates plot.


# Horizontal gene transfer identification

Finding out what determines probability of gene transfer.

Figure: network of gene transfer.


# How phylogenetics algorithms are applied in microbial ecology research

Very large data sets.

Some groups are not interested in accuracy per se.

Alignment.


# The challenge that lies ahead: functional genes and phylogenomics

There has been a shift from interest in community dynamics to fine-scale interactions between host and immune system.
