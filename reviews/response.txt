> Reviews from Prof. Frank (Andy) Anderson
> ----------------------------------------

> Thank you for your Systematic Biology submission. It has been reviewed
> by Associate Editor Prof. Olivier Gascuel and three reviewers. Their
> comments are listed at the end of this letter. The reviewers and the
> AE provide some excellent constructive suggestions that I am sure you
> will appreciate.

> I have little to add that wasn't covered by one or more reviewers or
> Olivier in their fine reviews. As an instructor who has almost given
> up on trying to convince microbiology graduate students that they can
> do better analyses than neighbor joining, I was already sensitive to
> some of these differences, but this review helped me appreciate the
> interface between the two disciplines. I agree with Mooers that the
> level of detail varies across the manuscript, but I mainly noticed
> when a topic was summarized quickly and I didn't really understand it
> (I note that Mooers and I both had a question about how tax2tree
> works).

> I have a few comments and questions that may help clarify some of the
> writing. Altogether, I think the manuscript really requires only
> several minor revisions.

> Like Olivier, I note that some of my comments may overlap those of the
> reviewers.

> 1) Pg. 9: "As described above "metagenome" means that data is sheared
> randomly across the genome rather than amplified from a specific
> location," - I assume you mean DNA is sheared randomly?

> 2) Remember, "data" still is a plural noun, at least under my watch!
> Check for "this data", "data is", "data was", etc

> 3) Pg. 10: I don't really understand what "tax2tree" does, based on
> the description here. Does that matter?

> 4) Pg. 14-15: I also don't really understand what UniFrac is or how it
> works, even after looking at Figure 2 (Olivier made a similar
> comment). Could we get some help here?

> 5) The figures need a bit of work. There seems to be some sort of
> equation at the bottom of Figure 1, but I can't decipher it. What do
> the colors mean in Figure 2? I don't find this to be very clear.

> 6) Pg. 20: "How to formulate a useful notion of independent contrasts
> (Felsenstein 1985) on such an object?" - Awkward wording.

> 7) Pg. 23: I don't understand the distinction between "base
> observations" and sample observations here. Can this be clarified?

> 8) Pg. 24: "Future will continue to bring deeper sequencing on more
> samples" - I guess this should be "The future will continue"?


> My recommendation is acceptance pending minor to major changes.
> Actually, no change asked by the reviewers and me (see below) requires
> major efforts, but we all come from different origins, with different
> points of view and expectations, and thus summing all these demands
> will require a bit of time and attention. Basically, we all ask for
> more details and comments here and there, to make the paper more
> precise, comprehensive and self-contained. I am confident that you'll
> find our suggestions useful. I don't believe that the paper should be
> shortened in some places (or very locally), as suggested by Arne
> Mooers. When submitting your revision, please prepare a cover letter
> containing all the comments by the referees and me, with your
> changes/responses.

> This was an interesting manuscript to read, and I compliment whoever
> thought to review Human Microbiome Research (HMR) for the SB

> on here, though I found the level of detail to be a bit uneven:
> sometimes we are told perhaps too much, and often, what feels like too
> little, in order to make the connections between HMR and SB. There is
> also seems to be some elision between HMR research and metagenomics
> more generally. That isn't a bad thing, but one does sometimes forget
> that we are focussed on HMR.

> This manuscript presents a review of how phylogenetic tree-thinking
> and methodology is currently used in the study of the human
> microbiome. The author not only reviews the different ways by which
> phylogenetics is currently percolated into microbial ecology, but also
> gives his personal views on the future phylogenetic challenges

> which I find well written. I only have minor comments/suggestions for
> potential improvement.

> Specific comments:
> 1. I think that it should be made clear, from the very beginning of
> the introduction, the definition of the microbiome in order to avoid
> confusion. Indeed, in the current literature, "microbiota" (i.e. the
> collection of microbes living in association with a given organism)
> and "microbiome" (i.e. the collection of genomes of those microbes)
> are more and more often used interchangeably, even though they are not
> referring to the same organizational level. In that sense, the
> definition of the "human microbiome" given at the top of page 5 ("The
> human microbiome is the collection of microbial organisms that live
> inside of and on the surface of humans.") does not seem to be
> accurate. Please clarify.

> 2. In the section introducing the human microbiome, I think that a
> paragraph on the origin and the way in which the microbiome is
> transmitted vertically between the mother and infant is lacking. The
> recent review on maternal transmission by Funkhouser and Bordenstein
> 2013 is cited later, but it would be nice to mention it on page 5,
> especially in the context of the some examples on the impact of birth
> method (vaginal birth vs. cesarean delivery) on future health of
> newborns.

> 3. On page 6, lines 26-27, it might be worth citing also the recent
> paper by Findley et al. (doi:10.1038/nature12171) on the topography of
> fungal and bacterial on human skin.

> 4. On page 6, line 56, maybe also specify that "survey" is the
> equivalent of barcoding, a term with which the Systematic Biology's
> community is more familiar.

> 5. On page 14, lines 14-19, maybe mention the widespread use of
> "rarefaction curves" to enable the comparison between samples of
> different sequencing depth or methods (e.g. 454 vs. Illumina).

> 6. On page 17, lines 54-55, please add some recent references on the
> current debate around the rooting of the placental tree. I don't think
> that most readers of Syst. Biol. will be familiar with this
> discussion.

> 7. On page 18, lines 26-27, RAxML is also implemented in QIIME.

> 8. On page 20, I think that this might be the place to discuss the
> potential use of phylogenetic networks in microbiome research (see
> Parks and Beiko 2012 Mol Biol Evol).

> 9. On page 24, when citing uBiome, it might also be fair to refer the
