> 1) Pg. 3: “It absolutely requires molecular methods because microbes are now primarily identified by their molecular sequences, which is much more straightforward to do in high throughput than morphological or phenotypic characterization” – This suggests that molecular sequences have traditionally been characterized via morphological or phenotypic means. I suppose that’s indirectly true, but I don’t think it is the best way to describe it.

I've clarified this, thanks.

> 2) Pg. 10: “Inference of this history is complicated by the fact that any tree-like signal in the overall evolution of bacteria is restricted to a small set of so-called “core” genes” – Would it be more accurate to write that tree-like signal regarding the deep relationships of bacteria is restricted to a small set of so-called “core” genes?  I suspect all genes carry some tree-like signal, even in microbes, though some have been subject to much more lateral gene transfer than others.

Absolutely. I've changed the text accordingly.

> 3) Pg. 14: “first with a Dirichlet multinomial mixtures on 3-mer profiles” – Should this just be “mixture”?

Right! Thanks.

> 4) Pg. 15: “However, whereas just about every of the hundreds or thousands of 16S surveys applies an OTU-based alpha diversity estimate” – This requires some modification.  Maybe add “one” after “every”.

Done, thanks.

> 5) Pg. 16: “PD under random sub-sampling, which is often applied to enable comparison be- tween samples of different sequencing depths and called “rarefaction curves.”” – Would it be preferable to write that the random subsamples are described (or depicted) with rarefaction curves?

You caught a strange sentence there. I've just cut the strange bits and linked to a later discussion.

> 6) Pg. 23: “The apparent success of 16S-tree-based comparisons begs the question of if a more complete representation of the evolutionary history…” – “Begging the question” means something else in philosophical circles. You should probably just use “raises the question” here.

I didn't know that! Thank you.

Thanks. I've added commas.

You are right. I've decided to just eliminate the technical sentences.
